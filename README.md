# Stream Deck
For the StreamDeck Club

## Usage
To install a profile on your Stream Deck
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a symbolic link 
  * From your terminal
    * Create a symbolic link that points to the location of your cloned repo
    * `sudo ln -s [PATH_TO_REPO] /usr/local/stream-deck`
    * Example: `sudo ln -s ~/projects/streamdeck /usr/local/stream-deck`
3. Browse to the project using finder
4. Navigate to `compiled-profiles` directory
5. Dbl-click the profile you want to install
  * Note: If you already have a profile with the same name, Stream Deck will create another one (doesn't replace the exisiting profile)

All profiles within this repo contain a **home** button that will switch you back to your 'Home' profile

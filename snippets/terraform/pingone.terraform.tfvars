#    Values below with no value (i.e. {{...}})
#
# Now, you can run your terraform commands.  In general the following steps will apply
# this plan to your environment:
#
#    terraform init                   // Download terraform providers/modules
#    terraform apply                  // Apply plan
#
# To destroy the environment:
#
#    terraform destroy                // Destroy what has been previously built
